Fast and simple PDF creation. Inspired by Bootstrap and uses [Gofpdf](https://github.com/jung-kurt/gofpdf).

You can create PDFs as if you were creating a website with Bootstrap. A row can have many columns, and a column can have many components. In addition, pages will be added when the content may go beyond the useful area. You can define a header that will always be added when a new page appears. In this case, the header can contain many rows, lines, or tables.

### Installation:
```sh
go get github.com/pchchv/bpdf
```
